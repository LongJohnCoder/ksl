@brief returns a continuous double precision angle obtained from atan2(y, x)

Caution: atan2(y,x) will return an angle with +-2m*pi accuracy only if the
sign on x and y are both correct. If x and y are both off by (-1) then
atan2 will return an angle with accuracy of only +-m*pi. If the sign of
x and y are uncertain, use the alternate function, catan1pi.

This function returns a continuous angle obtained from the standard math
atan2(y,x) function. On input, the argument theta contains the
previous value associated with the angle that is being computed.
catan2() adjusts the value returned from atan2(), so it will be as close to
theta as possible. The assumption is that the current value to be returned
by catan2() is not more than (+-)pi/4 from the previous value. This should
be a valid assumption, because angles generally don't change very fast over
the course of a simulation. Both input arguments x and y must have the
correct sign for catan2pi to work correctly.
