Roadmap
-----------

Refer to the  `Github issues page <https://github.com/shift-dynamics/ksl/issues>`_ for possible development tasks or contact the authors with other development/research ideas.


Using *Clang-Format*
-----------------------

The *KSL* repository contains a `Clang Format <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html>`_ configuration file that can be used to auto-format code to follow *KSL* coding conventions. If you are using the Atom text editor, you can install the `clang-format package <https://atom.io/packages/clang-format>`_ to autoformat code when you save  documents. Plugins are also available for other text editors.
